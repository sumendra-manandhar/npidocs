 ![Example Image](/img/card/clear-space.png)
 <p align="center" class="centered-caption"></p>

### 2.6.1	NEPALPAY logo – Do’s and Dont’s 


### 2.6.2  Clear Space for Logo


Clear space is the area that is required around the outside of the logo. It must be kept free of other graphic elements such as headlines, text, images and the outside edge of materials. The minimum required clear space for the logo is defined by the measurement “X” as shown in the illustration. This measurement of 'X' is equal to the width of the icon 'n' used in the Brand logo of National Payment Switch (NPS).  

 ![Example Image](/img/card/clear-space-for-logo.png)
 <p align="center" class="centered-caption"></p>



 ![Example Image](/img/card/clear-space-for-logo-second.png)
 <p align="center" class="centered-caption"></p>


## 2.1.	Typography


The brand’s typeface is Helvetica Neue font family in English documentation and Aakriti font Family for Nepali documentation. 



 ![Example Image](/img/card/Font-family.png)
 <p align="center" class="centered-caption"></p>

1.	National Payment Switch – with 'N' of National, 'P' of Payment and 'S' of Switch in uppercase, while rest all the letters in lowercase 
2.	NPS -  with all the letters in uppercase
3.	NEPALPAY - with all the letters in uppercase



## 2.2.	Improper Usage of logo


NPS brand lock up along with NPS logo mark, text of National Payment Switch and underlying tagline 'Unifying Payments for Nepal' are to be used to represent NPS and in similar line to be applicable for its sub-brands. Usage of any other mnemonic, icon, visual or graphic element even for representational purposes are prohibited.




 ![Example Image](/img/card/improper-usage-of-logo.png)
 <p align="center" class="centered-caption"></p>




## 2.3.	Brand Color


The brand colors used in the NPS, NEPALPAY and underlying brand logos are derived from Nepal’s flag color, namely red and blue, in order to emphasize the national brand for digital payment. The 'Red' color indicates the pro-activeness and aggressiveness as how the product is being driven and the excitement and confidence of the brand. And the 'Blue' color represents peace, harmony and calmness. Hence the amalgamation of the two colors in NPS and NEPALPAY logo connotes the calm yet aggressive approach for driving the product and/or services of NPS with multiple stakeholders at national level.

The brand mark and commonality of the brand along with sub-brands (products under NPS) will be reflected through the color palette, typography, imagery and logo mark.
