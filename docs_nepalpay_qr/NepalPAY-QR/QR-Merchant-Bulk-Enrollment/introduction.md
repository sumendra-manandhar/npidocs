# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 BACKGROUND
NEPALPAY QR is an implementing infrastructure of NepalQR, as per ‘NepalQR Standardization 
Framework and Guidelines’ issued by NRB, to bring uniformity for interoperability, scalability and security. 
It is operated by NCHL, as a clearing house, to establish QR scheme/network for its participating members 
and inter-network interoperable QR transaction settlement for participating other QR scheme operators. 
The underlying financial transactions are processed through one of the switches of National Payment 
Switch (NPS). Issuers or Issuer Networks provide instruments to their customers to read/ scan QR 
presented by Acquirer or Acquirer Network as creditor (beneficiary member or service provider or 
merchant). Issuers and Acquirers are normally BFIs or PSP and can use their own system or instruments 
or instrument provided by NCHL.

The objective of NEPALPAY QR is to:

i. Establish QR scheme/ network as per NepalQR standard.

ii. Establish interoperability for inter-network QR transactions in Nepal.

iii. Provide interfacing to NEPALPAY QR for Issuers/Issuer Networks and Acquirers/Acquirer Networks.

In addition to the standard issued by NCHL related to NEPALPAY QR previously (document reference 
NEPALPAY QR Technical & API Specification Ver 2.0), this document is subset of NEPALPAY QR 
Technical & API Specification Ver 2.0, with the changes relevant to web socket implementation only.

NEPALPAY QR Network. The intended audience for this document comprises of mainly technical resources 
or partners of the BFIs, Members of NCHL, service providers having technical expertise in system setup
