# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Background
NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL) and Nepal Clearing House Limited (NCHL) through
G2G collaboration of the respective countries have agreed to facilitate cross-border digital
payments between India and Nepal by integrating Unified Payments Interface (UPI) of India and
National Payments Interface (NPI) of Nepal. This collaboration intends to establish a seamless
cross border connectivity for financial transactions between the two countries to initially ease P2P
fund transfers followed by P2M merchant payments for the citizens of both countries.

   transactions often referred to as international remittances. It will be proxy address (Virtual
   Payment Address – VPA) based Account to Account xBorder fund transfer by means of
   interconnecting NPIx of NCHL and iUPI of NPCI. Existing issuing instruments or channels will
   be used to initiate such xBorder P2P transfer.

2. **Person-to-Merchant (P2M):** This is cross border merchant payment against purchase of
goods or services, where payer is an individual and payee is a registered merchant, with
transaction initiation using QR Payments. Existing issuing instruments or channels will be
used to initiate such xBorder P2M payments
