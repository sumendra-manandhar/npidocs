## 2.2.  Process/ Workflow of connectIPS Core Module 
 ### 2.2.1. Merchant Enrollment 

 1. Interested merchant having e-commerce/mobile application can enroll their application for connectIPS
through its bank by providing necessary supporting documents/ information. The bank will do the necessary 
KYC of the merchant and then send the details for creditor listing to NCHL for technical enrollment. 
2. The creditor/ merchant will be activated from the Merchant Enrollment page and the APIs exposed to the 
merchant for necessary integration in their e-commerce/mobile application. 
3. The system will send an email to the designated email id with Merchant Id and Password along with other 
information required to carry out its transaction. 
4. The merchant will be able to login into the web interface (Merchant Portal) and manage its operation from 
that portal for the needed reporting/ reconciliation. 
5. It will support multiple accounts for multiple applications of a single merchant/ creditor. i.e. each ecommerce 
application will be linked to single bank account only, but a merchant can establish multiple such applications.
