# 1.Introduction

The financial sector is constantly evolving, and payment gateways and service bill payments are 
becoming increasingly important in the Nepalese fintech market. The National Payments Interface 
(NPI) has been instrumental in enabling fund transfers and service payments through APIs, both 
within the channels provided by the Nepal Clearing House Limited (NCHL) and through alternate 
channels used by Banks and Financial Institutions (BFIs), Payment Service Providers (PSPs), and 
Payment System Operators (PSOs). However, the current system requires the integration of each 
service API into these alternate channels, which can be cumbersome.
To address this, the introduction of NPI Billers as an extension of the NPI can simplify this process. 
With this gateway, BFIs, PSPs, PSOs, and other third-party entities can easily offer various bundled 
services on their platforms, enhancing customer service. The NPI Billers, developed by NCHL, 
provides a unified web-platform (extended to SDK as well), which supports a wide range of service 
payments, from government and semi-government to commercial services. This integration 
facilitates third-party applications and systems in incorporating service payments securely and 
conveniently, streamlining the rollout of diverse services and improving operational efficiency in the 
Nepalese fintech landscape.
