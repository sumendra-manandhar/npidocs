# 1.Introduction

The process of innovation in financial sectors is dynamic and payment gateways and service bill 
payment are becoming an important trend in Nepalese fintech market. For this purpose, National 
Payments Interface (NPI) has played an important role in extending fund transfer and service payments 
through APIs both within the channels provided by NCHL and on the alternate channels of the BFIs, 
PSPs and PSOs. However, current approach requires integration of each of the service APIs in the 
alternate channels. Hence, with an objective to ensure service interoperability NPI-Biller Payment 
gateway or API as an extension of the NPI has been established, such that the BFIs, PSPs, PSOs and 
other third party entities can rollout the available service payment related use cases to their customer
by offering various types of bundled services in their platforms.
NPI-Billers is a unified platform developed by NCHL that offers bundled service payments ranging from 
non-conventional Govt/ Semi-Govt to commercial service payments. NPI-Biller is available as a User 
Interface (UI) or as a bundled interface (APIs) that can be used or integrated with third party application/
system for the service payment integration with minimal effort, in a secure and convenient manner.
